		dek: 'A grounded way to find the repetitive work worth automating, connect your tools, and add AI without creating a black box nobody can trust.',

		keyword: 'AI workflow automation for small business',
		intro: 'The useful AI projects are rarely the flashiest ones. They are the small, repeatable workflows that turn a slow handoff into a dependable system: a lead gets qualified, a support request gets routed, or a weekly report arrives already organized. This playbook explains how to start with that work and build toward automation that your team can actually operate.',
		sections: [
			{
				heading: 'Start with a workflow, not a model',
				paragraphs: [
					'“Add AI” is not a useful project brief. A workflow is. Write down the trigger, the inputs, the decision, the action, and the owner. If you cannot explain the current process in a few sentences, it is too early to automate it.',
					'Look for work that happens often, follows a recognizable pattern, and has a clear definition of done. That combination gives you a measurable baseline and a safe place for AI to assist rather than silently take over.',
				],
				bullets: ['Lead intake and qualification', 'Inbox or ticket triage', 'Document and meeting-note extraction', 'Weekly reporting and data reconciliation'],
			},
			{
				heading: 'Use AI where judgment is repetitive',
				paragraphs: [
					"Traditional automation is excellent at deterministic rules: if a form is submitted, create a record. AI helps when the input is messy but the output still has a useful shape: classify this request, extract these fields, or draft a response for review.",
					'The strongest production pattern in 2026 is usually hybrid. Code handles permissions, validation, retries, and side effects. A model handles the fuzzy middle. A person stays in the loop for high-impact decisions until the evidence says otherwise.',
				],
				bullets: ['Keep money movement and destructive actions behind explicit approval', 'Validate model output against a schema before it reaches another system', 'Store the source input and decision trail for debugging'],
			},
			{
				heading: 'Connect the systems you already use',
				paragraphs: [
					'An automation is only valuable when it crosses the gap between tools. That might mean a website form, CRM, help desk, calendar, accounting system, or private database. Map the system of record first, then give each integration one clear responsibility.',
					'Prefer stable APIs and webhooks over browser clicks. Use idempotency keys so retries do not create duplicate records, and make failures visible with a queue, an alert, or a small operations view. “It usually works” is not a monitoring strategy.',
				],
			},
			{
				heading: 'Measure the outcome before scaling',
				paragraphs: [
					'Choose one operational metric and one quality metric. For example: time from inquiry to first response, and the percentage of triage decisions accepted by a human reviewer. Compare them with a short baseline before you change the process.',
					'Once the workflow is reliable, improve cost, speed, and coverage one at a time. A smaller model may be enough for classification. A batch step may be better for reports. A human review queue may be the right answer for edge cases. The goal is not maximum autonomy; it is dependable leverage.',
				],
			},
			{
				heading: 'A sensible first project',
				paragraphs: [
					'For many small teams, a practical first project is an AI-assisted intake workflow: collect a request, extract structured details, check for missing information, route it to the right person, and draft the next reply. It is narrow enough to test, useful enough to matter, and flexible enough to grow.',
					'At PilotLab, we design these systems around your existing tools and operating habits. That means a clear scope, a visible audit trail, documented failure paths, and a handover your team can maintain—not a mysterious demo that only works for its creator.',
